        <p>Holy fucking shit I am so god damn tired of seeing stupid mother fuckers put shitty ass code in their about me, it doesn't make you look cool. It makes you look fucking stupid. You aren't cool because you know the basics of Python of Javascript, all you did was fucking declare "oh yeah i know this and this and i can do this" oh my fucking god I do not give a shit please shut the fuck up</p>
        <b>Yes I know I'm a hipocrite for hiding this stupid fucking website inside of code and then slapping it on my about me. Do I give a shit? Fuck no and fuck you for even thinking I do.</b>
